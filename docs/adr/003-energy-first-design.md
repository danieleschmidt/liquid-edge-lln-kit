# ADR-003: Energy-First Design Philosophy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Edge robotics applications are severely power-constrained, often running on batteries for extended periods. Traditional neural networks consume too much energy for practical deployment. We need a design philosophy that prioritizes energy efficiency as a first-class constraint.

## Decision

We will adopt an "Energy-First" design philosophy where all architectural decisions are evaluated primarily based on their energy impact, with performance and accuracy as secondary considerations.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enables practical deployment on battery-powered robots
- Forces innovative optimization techniques
- Aligns with sustainability goals
- Differentiates from existing ML frameworks
- Drives hardware-aware model design

**Negative:**
- May sacrifice some accuracy for efficiency
- Requires extensive energy profiling infrastructure
- Increases development complexity
- May limit some advanced ML techniques
- Requires domain expertise in power optimization

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Performance-First**: Traditional approach, unsuitable for edge deployment
2. **Accuracy-First**: Academic approach, impractical for resource constraints
3. **Memory-First**: Important but energy is more limiting factor
4. **Balanced Approach**: Would dilute our unique value proposition

## Implementation Notes

- Integrate energy estimation into training loops
- Provide comprehensive energy profiling tools
- Design sparse architectures by default
- Implement adaptive inference scheduling
- Create energy budgeting APIs for applications
- Benchmark all optimizations against energy consumption
