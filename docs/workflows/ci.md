# Continuous Integration Workflow

## Overview

This document describes the CI/CD workflow requirements for the Liquid Edge LLN Kit. Since this repository focuses on defensive security, actual GitHub Actions workflows should be manually created by repository maintainers.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Test Workflow (`test.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main
- Manual dispatch

**Matrix Strategy:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Python environment
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
4. Run linting: `ruff check src/ tests/`
5. Run type checking: `mypy src/`
6. Run tests: `pytest --cov=liquid_edge`
7. Upload coverage to codecov

### 2. Security Workflow (`security.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Schedule: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- Push to main branch

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Run dependency security scan: `safety check`
3. Run code security analysis: `bandit -r src/`
4. Run SAST analysis with CodeQL
5. Check for secrets: `truffleHog`

### 3. Documentation Workflow (`docs.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests affecting docs/

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Python
3. Install docs dependencies
4. Build documentation
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages (main branch only)

### 4. Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push of version tags (v*)

**Steps:**
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Python
3. Build package: `python -m build`
4. Run tests on built package
5. Upload to PyPI (production)
6. Create GitHub release with changelog

## Quality Gates

### Pull Request Requirements
- All tests pass
- Code coverage >90%
- No linting errors
- Type checking passes
- Security scan clean
- Documentation updated
- Reviewed by maintainer

### Main Branch Protection
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Restrict pushes to main
- Require up-to-date branches
- Include administrators in restrictions

## Environment Variables

### Required Secrets
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For package publishing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting
- `SECURITY_SCAN_TOKEN`: For security tooling

### Configuration
- Python version matrix in strategy
- Dependency caching for faster builds
- Artifact retention for 30 days
- Concurrent job limits for resource management

## Integration Requirements

### External Services
- **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting
- **PyPI**: Package distribution
- **ReadTheDocs**: Documentation hosting
- **Dependabot**: Dependency updates

### Notifications
- Slack integration for build failures
- Email notifications for security issues
- GitHub status checks for PR validation

## Hardware Testing

### MCU Deployment Testing
- Cross-compilation validation
- Size analysis of generated binaries
- Static analysis of C code output
- Memory usage profiling

### Performance Benchmarks
- Inference speed measurements
- Memory usage tracking
- Energy consumption estimation
- Comparison with baseline models

## Deployment Pipeline

### Development Branch
1. Feature development and testing
2. Local quality checks
3. Pull request creation
4. CI validation and review
5. Merge to main

### Release Branch
1. Version bump and changelog
2. Full test suite execution
3. Security validation
4. Package building and validation
5. PyPI publishing
6. Documentation deployment
7. GitHub release creation

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Build success/failure rates
- Test execution times
- Coverage trends over time
- Security scan results
- Dependency update frequency

### Alerting
- Build failures on main branch
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Coverage drops below threshold
- Performance regression detection

## Manual Setup Instructions

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Add workflow files based on templates above
3. Configure repository secrets
4. Enable branch protection rules
5. Set up external service integrations
6. Configure notification preferences
7. Test workflows with sample commits
