# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

## Project: Liquid Edge LLN Kit

### Overview
This document defines the service level objectives (SLOs) and agreements for the Liquid Edge LLN Kit project, establishing expectations for performance, reliability, and support.

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### 1. Code Quality SLOs

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Test Coverage | ≥ 90% | Measured by pytest-cov on every PR |
| Build Success Rate | ≥ 99% | CI pipeline success rate over 30 days |
| Security Vulnerabilities | 0 critical, ≤ 2 high | Weekly security scans |
| Documentation Coverage | ≥ 95% | API documentation completeness |

### 2. Performance SLOs

| Component | Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Model Inference | Latency | ≤ 10ms (STM32H7) | Benchmark suite |
| Model Training | Memory Usage | ≤ 2GB peak | Memory profiler |
| Code Generation | Build Time | ≤ 30s | CI build metrics |
| API Response | Time to First Result | ≤ 100ms | Integration tests |

### 3. Reliability SLOs

| Service | Availability | Error Rate | Recovery Time |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| CI/CD Pipeline | 99.5% | ≤ 1% | ≤ 15 minutes |
| Documentation Site | 99.9% | ≤ 0.1% | ≤ 5 minutes |
| Package Registry | 99.8% | ≤ 0.5% | ≤ 10 minutes |
| Issue Response | N/A | N/A | ≤ 48 hours |

### 4. Security SLOs

| Area | Target | Measurement |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Dependency Vulnerabilities | 0 critical, ≤ 1 high | Daily automated scans |
| Code Security Issues | 0 critical, ≤ 2 medium | Static analysis (Bandit) |
| Container Security | No critical vulnerabilities | Trivy scans |
| Secret Detection | 0 exposed secrets | TruffleHog scans |

## Support Commitments

### Issue Response Times

| Priority | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Critical (P0) | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| High (P1) | 12 hours | 3 days |
| Medium (P2) | 2 days | 1 week |
| Low (P3) | 1 week | 1 month |

### Priority Definitions

- **Critical (P0)**: Security vulnerabilities, complete system failure
- **High (P1)**: Core functionality broken, major performance regression
- **Medium (P2)**: Feature requests, minor bugs, documentation issues
- **Low (P3)**: Enhancement requests, optimization suggestions

## Maintenance Windows

### Scheduled Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Sundays 02:00-04:00 UTC for dependency updates
- **Monthly**: First Sunday 01:00-06:00 UTC for major updates
- **Emergency**: As needed with 24-hour notice when possible

### Notification Channels
- GitHub Discussions for planned maintenance
- Issue tracker for incident updates
- Repository README for current status

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Developer Experience**
   - Time to first successful build: ≤ 5 minutes
   - Documentation search success rate: ≥ 95%
   - Issue resolution satisfaction: ≥ 4.5/5

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Code review approval rate: ≥ 90%
   - Regression rate: ≤ 2% per release
   - API backward compatibility: 100% within major versions

3. **Community Health**
   - Response time to new contributors: ≤ 24 hours
   - Documentation update frequency: Weekly
   - Example code maintenance: Monthly reviews

### Alerting Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Build failure rate | > 5% | > 15% |
| Test duration | > 10 minutes | > 20 minutes |
| Memory usage (CI) | > 4GB | > 6GB |
| Security scan failures | > 0 | > 2 |

## Compliance and Reporting

### Monthly SLA Reports
- Performance metrics summary
- Availability statistics
- Security posture assessment
- Community engagement metrics

### Quarterly Reviews
- SLO target adjustments
- Infrastructure capacity planning
- Security audit findings
- Dependency health assessment

## Exception Handling

### SLA Breach Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Automated alert to maintainers
2. **Within 1 hour**: Root cause analysis initiated
3. **Within 4 hours**: Status update to community
4. **Within 24 hours**: Detailed incident report
5. **Within 1 week**: Post-mortem and prevention measures

### Force Majeure
SLA obligations are suspended during:
- GitHub service outages
- Third-party service failures beyond our control
- Natural disasters affecting core team
- Critical security incidents requiring immediate action

## Continuous Improvement

### SLA Evolution
- Monthly review of SLO targets
- Quarterly stakeholder feedback collection
- Annual comprehensive SLA revision
- Community input integration

### Feedback Mechanisms
- GitHub Discussions for SLA feedback
- Anonymous feedback form
- Community surveys (quarterly)
- Maintainer office hours (monthly)

## Contact Information

### Escalation Path
1. **L1**: GitHub Issues (community support)
2. **L2**: GitHub Discussions (maintainer review)
3. **L3**: Direct maintainer contact (critical issues)
4. **L4**: Security advisory channel (security issues)

### Team Responsibilities
- **Core Team**: P0/P1 issues, architectural decisions
- **Contributors**: P2/P3 issues, feature development
- **Community**: Testing, documentation, feedback
