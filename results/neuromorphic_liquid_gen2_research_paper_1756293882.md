## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Temporal Coherence Bridging (TCB)
The core innovation lies in bridging continuous liquid dynamics with discrete spike events:

```
Bridge State Evolution:
bridge_state(t+dt) = bridge_state(t) * exp(-dt/τ_bridge) + 
                     coherence_strength * (liquid_influence + spike_influence)

Bidirectional Coupling:
liquid_influence = TCB(spike_state → liquid_state)
spike_influence = TCB(liquid_state → spike_state)
```

**Key Parameters:**
- Bridge time constant: 0.5ms
- Coherence strength: 0.9
- Sparse connectivity: 70% connections

### 3.2 Adaptive Liquid-Spiking Dynamics (ALSD)
Context-aware processing with adaptive time constants:

```
Adaptive Time Constants:
τ(t) = τ_min + (τ_max - τ_min) * σ(adaptation_factor)

Multi-Scale Processing:
y(t) = Σ(scale_weight * tanh(input / temporal_scale))

Liquid Evolution:
dh/dt = (-h + tanh(W_input * x + W_recurrent * h)) / τ_adaptive
```
